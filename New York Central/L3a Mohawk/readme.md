This project is marked *Completed.

Notes: On the sand box three things are intentionally not prototypically accurate:  I increased the thickness of the base sheeting to help the print from failing.  Afterwords if that extra 0.5" is a bother you can sand it back with a dowel and some paper before fitting.  Also the handrails are 1/4" thicker for strength.  If they fail the bosses will still be there so a wire handgrab can be located.  Lastly the weld seam is oversized to a 1/4" bead to help it show up.
