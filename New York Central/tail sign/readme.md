* This project is marked Completed.

I designed the rear housing a tad deeper to accomodate a surface mount LED.  Best practice is to print flat to the plate, and then remove any resulting flashing around the perimeter.  Adjust your printer settings, primarily exposure duration until you can get the interior of the 'R' to be open.  If you feel bolder than me paint the lettering black.  Lastly, cut a square of light blue lighting gel as a backer.
