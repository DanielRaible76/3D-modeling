This project is marked *Completed.

The rear of the parts may need some minor trimming/sanding where a fillet may form at the printer plate interface.

The O-scale version can be backlit, by inserting a piece of ruby gel film from the rear.

The HO and N versions are best printed in clear red resin, and then drybrushed silver.
