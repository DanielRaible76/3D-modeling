US&S color light signal and battery well, dimensions taken from remaining units near Celina, OH.

The purpose of these is to be the most scale-rendition possible of the signal, which is great for a foreground location.  As is they are non-operational, as the very slender mast and light housings are true to the prototype.  However, if you wanted to drill out for wiring you could do so, but at the compromise of scale fidelity.

I usually print parts using 20 micrometer slices at a time, with an exposure setting of around 1.7 seconds per slice to cure the resin.  For something a bit tricky and fragile like these, I bumped that up to 2.0 seconds to create a stronger, and very slightly thicker part.  Every molecule helps!  Therefore, whatever resin you are using, if you run into trouble getting something delicate to fully form (like this), don't forget your big tuning dial of exposure time on the printer.  That control can really make a difference.  In the background you can see my strategy for support structure, and printing straight up and down.
