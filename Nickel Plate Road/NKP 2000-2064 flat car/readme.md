Under development, inital test printed successfully.

2000-series trailer on flatcars rebuilt from earlier NKP and W&LE boxcars.  Bottom of centerbeam includes a channel to add weight.  Options provided for both roll-off bridges (car #'s 2000-2064) and fold down / torsion spring bridges (car #'s 2065-2262).  Also external parts for coupler covers and Brandon wheel chocks.

My thoughts are to print the center beam out of metal for increased weight, and the surrounding detailed sill structure from resin.  Also the bridges and jack could be made from metal for additional weight.
