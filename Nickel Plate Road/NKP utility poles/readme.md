Several variations of finescale communications and power poles.  35' tall, and there is a hole on the bottom for mounting with a piece of wire.  From the NKP literature double arms are required on all poles:

A - Where a wire dead-ends one way.

B - Where more than 3 wires double dead end.

C - Where a wire dead-ends and changes its pin position.

D - At railroad crossings.

E - At long span locations.
