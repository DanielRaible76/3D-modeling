Several variations of communications and power poles.  There is a hole on the bottom for mounting with a piece of wire.  From the NKP literature double arms are required on all poles:
A - Where a wire dead-ends one way.
B - Where more than 3 wires double dead end.
C - Where a wire dead-ends and changes its pin position.
D - At railroad crossings.
E - At long span locations.
