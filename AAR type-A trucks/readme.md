Finescale trucks of the earlier AAR type-A with 5" leafs, double-coil springs and cotter-pinned brake hardware. 

The sideframe file is adapted to fit to Atlas SW drive units, by dropping two M2 nuts into each sideframe for attachment.  For teh Atlas application, the sand lines needed to be removed for tank clearance.  However the sanders are still present, and could be used to attach flexible sand lines if you so desire, such as with using electrical wire insulation.
