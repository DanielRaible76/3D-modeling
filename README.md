## This is my design space of 3D models for printing.

### Description

Welcome to the 3D project page!  This is a series of primarily 1/48 O-scale finescale designs, in 'STL' format for printing.  Most prototype subjects are from the Great Lakes region.  All files hosted here have been successfully printed using resin technology (unless otherwise noted).  From here you can use the files to generate your own prints at home, or utilize a commercial print service.  I am using this site as a way to collaborate with ongoing custom work, and share model revisions under development.

Contributions most welcome!

### Printing Tips

Care must be taken during slicer preparation of the files to maintain the fidelity of the prints, and some experimentation may be needed to generate the best results.  Printers capable of at least 8K resolution should be used.  Typical high-detail settings must be set, and you shoud pay close attention to adjusting:
  1. Part orientation/rotation
  2. Support structures and bracing
  3. Layer thickness
  4. Exposure time per layer
  5. Initial bonding layers

I made a candid video documenting some 3D printing techniques using several examples.  This is targeted for both people who haven't seen the process up close before, and for those seeking some help with printing small and challenging details:

### Other Ways to Contribute

I welcome any and all contributions!  Here are some ways you can get started:
  1. Report bugs: If you encounter any bugs, please let me know. Open up an issue and let me know the problem.
  2. Research and Evaluation: Contribute to my technical understanding of the prototypes, participate in evaluating the models, share how you have utilized them with your own projects.
  3. Suggestions: If you have some awesome ideas, open up an issue explaining some improvements or designs you would like to see.
  4. Documentation: If you see the need for some additional documentation or pictures, feel free to add some.

### About Me

Daniel Raible resides near Cleveland, Ohio, where his lifelong fascination with industry and transportation first took shape. Growing up amidst an industrial landscape which included the American Ship Building Company, Republic Steel Corporation, and a colorful mosaic of merging railroads, Daniel was inspired by the constant motion and adaptation of these enterprises. The local abundance of lift bridges, ore unloaders and coal docks offered him a lot of subjects to study, and rail-watching at busy places like Berea nurtured a deep interest in industrial archaeology and transportation history.

Today, Daniel combines those interests with his craftsmanship in woodworking and kitbashing to create unique models of Midwestern prototypesâ€”particularly those of the Nickel Plate Road and the Lake Shore Electric Railway. In recent years, he has embraced 3D design and printing to produce distinctive finescale parts, and even completes entire 3D models made from resin, brass, and stainless steel.

A strong advocate of open-source collaboration, Daniel freely shares his designs online (github.com/DanielRaible76/3D-modeling) and conducts clinics and online tutorials to share techniques, exchange ideas, and crowdsource new projects. Looking ahead, he aims to continue expanding the library of shared components and to promote the creative and technical possibilities offered by O-scale modeling.
