Description

Welcome to the 3D project page!  This is a series of 1/48 O-scale superdetail designs, in .stl format.  All files hosted here have been successfully printed using resin technology (unless otherwise noted).  

Printing

Care must be taken during slicer preparation of the files to maintain the fidelity of the prints, and some experimentation may be needed to generate the best results.  Typical high-detail settings must be used, and you shoud pay close attention to adjusting:
  1. Part orientation
  2. Support structures
  3. Layer thickness
  4. Exposure time per layer
  5. Initial bonding layers
