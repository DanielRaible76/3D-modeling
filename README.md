## This is a list of 3D models for printing.

### Description

Welcome to the 3D project page!  This is a series of 1/48 O-scale superdetail designs, in 'STL' format.  Most prototype subjects are from the Great Lakes region.  All files hosted here have been successfully printed using resin technology (unless otherwise noted).  From here you can use the files to generate your own prints at home, or utilize a print farm service.  I am using this site as a way to collaborate with ongoing custom work, and share model revisions under development.

### Printing Tips

Care must be taken during slicer preparation of the files to maintain the fidelity of the prints, and some experimentation may be needed to generate the best results.  Printers capable of at least 8K resolution should be used.  Typical high-detail settings must be set, and you shoud pay close attention to adjusting:
  1. Part orientation/rotation
  2. Support structures and bracing
  3. Layer thickness
  4. Exposure time per layer
  5. Initial bonding layers

### How to Contribute

I welcome any and all contributions!  Here are some ways you can get started:
  1. Report bugs: If you encounter any bugs, please let me know. Open up an issue and let me know the problem.
  2. Research and Evaluation: Contribute to our technical understanding of the prototypes, participate in evaluating the models, share how you have utilized them with your own projects.
  3. Suggestions: If you have some awesome ideas, open up an issue explaining some updates or improvements you would like to see.
  4. Documentation: If you see the need for some additional documentation or pictures, feel free to add some.
