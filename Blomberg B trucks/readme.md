Martin Blomberg early-style B (EMD-GP) trucks from LFM casting.  This is a work in progress, generating finescale designs for both the initial plain bearing and later roller bearing variants.  

LFM Blomberg truck frames have narrow outer journal guides with a notch at the bottom, inspection holes looking into the spring assembly, a nearly symmetrical and arch-shaped rib above the springs, and end transoms with a C-shaped cross section giving a rounded bottom.
